# hello-world-
My first repository when I joined Github!

Apparently I have to write a bit about myself, so here goes!
I live in South Africa and I started learning to code HTML 
back in high school. It was only until last year that I decided
I wanted to try out programming and persue it as a career.
Since then, I have learned more about HTML, did courses on
CSS and Bootstrap. Currently, I am busy with Javascript 
and have a few languages I am gonna start with after I'm done
with JS that include node.js, react.js and python etc.

My own website is gonna be my first project that will house
my curriculum vitae as well as links to projects I have contributed
to or done on my own.

I'm very excited to get started with Github and see how it will help me in the coming years as I continue to get
better at all of this :)
